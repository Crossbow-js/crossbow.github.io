Install this package with the `-g` flag to enable the CLI

```bash
npm install -g crossbow
```

If you're using a `cbfile.js` (in the style of Gulp.js), you'll
*also* need to install the package to your local directory.

```bash
$ npm install crossbow
```

{{inc src="video-list.hbs" videos=page.videos}}
