# File and Directories

Crossbow will look in your current directory for any of
the following files to use as your input.

```
cbfile.js
crossbow.yaml
crossbow.js
crossbow.json
```

Note: Crossbow does not *require* you to use an input file,
but it's the recommended approach for standardising tasks
across teams.
