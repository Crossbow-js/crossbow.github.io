On a mission to unify the use & configuration of the following:

- plain functions
- gulp-style streaming tasks
- tasks splits into separate files
- shell scripts
- NPM scripts.

## What's different?

We are NOT creating a whole new eco-system of plugins, rather we enable re-use and composition
of your **exiting** tools,
all powerered by a **powerful task resolution system**, **an extremely reliable execution
technique**,
by offering **best-in-game error handling** and finally by offering features that are simply
**not possible in other tools**.
